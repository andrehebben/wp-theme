# Sample Site Content Plan

This folder contains sample HTML pages that can be placed into WordPress as raw HTML blocks using the **Minimal IT Solutions Manager** theme. The site targets two audiences:

1. **Potential Clients** — organizations seeking Andre Hebben's IT expertise or professional collaboration.
2. **Professional Contacts** — individuals looking up Andre's background and experience.

## Navigation Structure

- `index.html` – Home
- `about.html` – About Andre
- `services.html` – IT Services
- `projects.html` – Featured Projects
- `resume.html` – Resume Highlights
- `contact.html` – Contact

Each file includes a streamlined HTML template that aligns with 2025 design trends such as dark‑mode awareness, accessible typography and mobile‑first layout. Paste the snippets into Gutenberg blocks to build out the complete site.
