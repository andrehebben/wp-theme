# Minimal IT WordPress Theme

This repository contains **Minimal IT Solutions Manager**, a minimalist WordPress theme designed to showcase a professional resume, blog, and contact page. The theme now uses [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) for its responsive grid and components while remaining lightweight.

All content can be built using the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg), giving you a flexible page builder experience out of the box.

## Structure
- `minimal-it/` – Theme directory
  - `style.css` – Theme information and basic styling
  - `functions.php` – Theme setup and asset loading
  - `header.php`, `footer.php` – Common layout files
  - `index.php`, `page.php`, `single.php` – Template files
  - `page-resume.php` – Resume page template
  - `page-contact.php` – Contact page template
  - `theme.json` – Block editor configuration

To use the theme, copy the `minimal-it` folder into your WordPress `wp-content/themes` directory and activate it from the WordPress dashboard.

Once activated, create pages and posts using the block editor. The theme provides a clean Bootstrap layout and a small color palette defined in `theme.json` for easy customization.
